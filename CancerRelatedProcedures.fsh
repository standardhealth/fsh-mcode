Parent:   USCoreProcedure
Id:       CancerRelatedRadiationProcedure
Title:    "Cancer-Related Radiation Procedure"
Description: "A radiological treatment addressing a cancer condition. The scope of this profile has been narrowed to cancer-related procedures by constraining the ReasonReference and ReasonCode to cancer conditions. 

Conformance note: If an ICD-10-PCS code is used in the code attribute, and there is a semantically equivalent SNOMED CT or CPT code, the resulting Procedure instance will not be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html)"
/* Issues relative to mCODE 0.9.x
1) basedOn should not include ProcedureRequest. No such class in R4.
2) basedOn should include CarePlan
3) partOf should probably not include MedicationAdministration or Observation.
4) recorder should include PractitionerRole and not include RelatedPerson
5) Practitioner in recorder should not be restricted to US Core Practitioner (US Core doesn't do that)
6) performer.actor, restricted to Reference(US Core Practitioner Profile) in mCODE, should be relaxed to Practitioner
7) performer.actor should allow PractitionerRole and Organization, and maybe allow Device (to allow recording of the device used in the radiation procedure)
8) location should not be restricted to US Core Location (US Core doesn't). Relax to Reference(Location)
9) Subject should at least be constrained to US Core Patient (US Core does), and maybe constrained to CancerPatient
10) Encounter should not be constrained to US Core Encounter -- US Core doesn't have this constraint
11) report should allow Reference(DiagnosticReport | DocumentReference | Composition) -- currently mCODE constrains to DiagnosticReport only.
